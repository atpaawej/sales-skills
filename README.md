# Sales Skills for Builders

## You can build it. Now teach your agent to help you sell it.

A framework of composable agent skills for **pre-revenue technical founders** who have a product and need customers. Each skill does one thing. They work together. And they store everything in a workspace so you never start from zero.

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/atpaawej/sales-skills)](https://skills.sh/atpaawej/sales-skills)

Built from the [Sales for Builders](https://salesforbuilders.aawej.in/) course — psychology fundamentals, practical playbooks, and frameworks that actually work in 2026.

## Why this exists

Most technical founders know how to build but never learned how to sell. The standard advice — "just talk to customers" — is true but useless. What do you say? Who do you talk to? How do you handle "it's too expensive"?

This skills framework turns the course's knowledge into **repeatable, agent-executable workflows**. Not hype. Not theory. Just structured steps that produce real output you can use today.

## Installation

Install all skills with one command:

```bash
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills
```

The CLI auto-detects your agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Cline, and 70+ more) and prompts you to pick which skills to install.

### Options

```bash
# Install to all agents without prompts
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills --all

# Install only specific skills
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills --skill icp-definer --skill cold-email-writer

# Install globally (available in every project)
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills -g

# Install to specific agents only
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills -a claude-code -a cursor

# List available skills without installing
npx skills add atpaawej/sales-skills --list

# Use one skill without installing
npx skills use atpaawej/sales-skills@icp-definer | claude
```

### After Installation

Once installed, open your agent inside your product folder and run:

```bash
/init-sales-workspace
```

This creates a `.sales/` workspace in your current directory. Then run `/sales-navigator` to see your status.

## How it works

```

Every skill reads from and writes to a `.sales/` directory in your project folder. Data persists. Sessions resume. Skills build on each other.

```
my-product-sales/
└── .sales/
    ├── context.md              # Product info and founder context
    ├── icp.md                  # Ideal Customer Profile
    ├── value-proposition.md    # Positioning and messaging
    ├── competitors.md          # Competitive landscape
    ├── pricing.md              # Pricing tiers and strategy
    ├── outreach/               # Outreach sequences and results
    ├── pipeline.md             # Deal tracker
    ├── content-calendar.md     # Content plan
    └── calls/                  # Call preps and notes
```

## Principles

- **One skill, one job.** Each skill does exactly one thing well.
- **Agent writes, founder sends.** No illusion of progress. The agent prepares; the founder executes.
- **Workspace as source of truth.** Skills compose through shared files, not session memory.
- **Start with who, not how.** `/icp-definer` comes first because everything else depends on knowing who you're selling to.
